You sail in the seas of eternal night to Accordia.
Vengeful spirits will haunt and stress your oarsmen.
For protection, you brought along the Bell of Souls.
Striking it will banish all spirits around at the cost of a man's soul.
You need at least 20 oarsmen to move the ship. Losing too much will result in failure.
